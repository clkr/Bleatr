From the "CoreBluetooth and iOS" talk at NSMeetup, February 12 2014


This is example code for doing phone - to - phone communications on iOS.  It should give you some place to start.  Please feel free to rip bits of it off and use them.

Please do not use the program in its entirety, that's cheating!  This is here to help you all make something neat and play with BLE.

I make no guarantees as to how well this thing works, and I can guarantee that none of this code is fit to ship.
